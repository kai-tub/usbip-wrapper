# USB/IP Wrapper

A nice wrapper around the [USB/IP tool](https://usbip.sourceforge.net/).
With some special âœ¨ for NixOS users.

## USB/IP: TL;DR

From the [USB/IP Project page](https://usbip.sourceforge.net/):
> USB/IP Project aims to develop a general USB device sharing system over IP network.
To share USB devices between computers with their full functionality,
USB/IP encapsulates "USB I/O messages" into TCP/IP payloads and transmits them between computers.

<!-- It has been upstreamed into the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/readme/tools-usb-usbip-README) for quite some time -->

### Why do I need USB/IP?

My current use case is that this allows me to remotely mount my [USB key with a key file](https://tqdev.com/2022-luks-with-usb-unlock) or my
_real_ [YubiKey 5 series hardware key](https://www.yubico.com/de/store/#yubikey-5-series) from my laptop to my server to decrypt my storage pools after a reboot.

Others use it to remotely mount old Linux-supported printers.

If you have a different interesting use case, let me know!

### Why should I look at this repository?

Good question! This repository contains two helpful components:
- The actual `usbip_wrapper` tool
- A [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) module that provides a simple entry point to set up the USB/IP host/client on a NixOS system with a secure auto-mount procedure.
If you are a NixOS user, check out the [NixOS Module section](#nixos-module)!

The `usbip_wrapper` tool provides a more user- and scripting-friendly interface to the
`usbip` program:
- Supports remotely mounting multiple USB devices from the same manufacturer.
  - This is a limitation of the [binding tutorial from Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB/IP#Tips_and_tricks)
  - May mount _all available_ devices from a host without having to explicitly list all USB IDs
  - May unmount _all locally_ mounted USB devices from USB/IP
- Acts _idempotent_ and only returns non-zero status codes for _true_ errors
- Gives more helpful error messages to make it easier to debug
- Provides a unified interface with identical environment variables for the host and client application

<!-- Idempotent: - If all desired remote USB devices have already been mounted then re-calling mount won't provide an error. -->

If you only want to use USB/IP directly check out the [Arch-Linux USB/IP wiki entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB/IP).

## Usage

Note: You still have to install the `usbip` package and the required kernel modules for
the host/client. See the [Arch Linux USB/IP documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB/IP)
for some pointers. If you are using NixOS, see the [NixOS Module](#nixos-module) section!

After adding the compiled binary to your `PATH` or after running `cargo install`
you can simply view the CLI documentation with `--help`:

```
Simple program to bind/unbind USB devices via USBIP.
  The script is idempotent and will return non-zero status-codes
  only for _true_ errors.
  In contrast to `usbip` it won't raise an error if the device
  is already bound/unbounded and the command is repeated.
  The program will handle multiple USB devices with the same VendorID
  gracefully and will bind/unbind all matching devices.
  This happens frequently when multiple Hardware keys from the same vendor
  are plugged in.
  It also accepts multiple VendorIDs and will only apply it to those that
  are present.

Usage: usbip_wrapper <COMMAND>

Commands:
  host              Bind USB device
  unhost            Unbind USB device If unhosted while remote is still connected, it seems
                        like it will also be disconnected from the client without any issues
  start-usb-hoster  Start usbip daemon via `usbipd`
  list-hostable     List all devices that can be hosted, i.e. all USB devices that are
                        connected locally
  list-mountable    List all devices that can be mounted from an usbip host. Defaults to
                        `localhost` which allows to quickly debug if previous mounted usb
                        devices were attached correctly. For _real_ use, please overwrite the
                        `host` value to the external usbip host/server
  mount-remote      Mount devices from an usbip host
  unmount-remote    Unmount remote device Required (!) to be able to re-mount the USB
                        device again and might cause problems if not done. Especially during
                        restarts for example If usbip port is not executed with `root`
                        priveliges, it will still work, but the host will be called `unknown
                        host, remote port and remote busid` but it will still list the used
                        port and the usbid
  help              Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

### USB-IDs

To find the USB ID of the device you would like to mount, call `lsusb` and copy the hex code after `ID` `XXXX:XXXX`.

Or, the _official_ list of known USB IDs can be found at [linux-usb.org/usb.ids](http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids).

For example, the hardware key manufacturer of the [YubiKey 5 Series](https://www.yubico.com/de/store/#yubikey-5-series),
[yubico](https://www.yubico.com/), is listed as *Yubico.com* with the _vendor_ id 1050.
For each of the registered products, there are different unique _product_ ids, which look (at the time of writing) like this:

```
1050  Yubico.com
	0010  Yubikey (v1 or v2)
	0110  Yubikey NEO(-N) OTP
    [...]
	0406  Yubikey 4/5 U2F+CCID
	0407  Yubikey 4/5 OTP+U2F+CCID
	0410  Yubikey plus OTP+U2F
```

## NixOS Module

The project also provides a NixOS module.
NixOS is treated as a first-class citizen and makes it trivial to
deploy a USB/IP host/client infrastructure securely with minimal
footprint and auto-mount capabilities.

In short, importing the module this flake provides:
- `services.usbip_wrapper_client`
  - Creates a `systemd` Unit file that connects to a specified host and
  mounts the listed USB devices.
  - The basis for further `systemd` customization/logic to load the unit file
  as a dependency of a different one or chain multiple together with different
  possible hosts.
- `services.usbip_wrapper_host`
  - Creates a few `systemd` Unit files that automatically start and manage
  the `usbip` server for a specific amount of time and automatically
  hosts the listed USB devices if available.
  - Usually does not require any further configuration

The NixOS Module also ensures that the _correct_ `usbip` version is used, i.e., from the kernel version of the host, and loads the required kernel
_modules_ depending on which unit is activated.

This means that from the viewpoint of a NixOS user, all of the complexity
associated with installing the `usbip` package, required _kernel modules_, and
configuring a secure auto-mount pipeline is done automatically and one only
needs to configure the desired behavior, showing the _real strength_ of NixOS :heart: .

For more information about the different configuration options, please see the
source module file at [./nix/usbip_wrapper.nix](./nix/usbip_wrapper.nix).
A nicer auto-generated documentation is planned.
For a detailed overview of the inner workings of the auto-mount `systemd` pipeline,
please take a look at the [./docs/systemd_doc.md](./docs/systemd_doc.md).

## Testing

The project contains _unit tests_ that are directly embedded inside
the Rust code.
Simply run `cargo test` to execute them.

The project also contains a very complex _integration test suite_.
This test suite ensures that the NixOS Module and all of the provided
configuration options work as expected, but it also ensures that the
USB/IP package behaves as expected under different scenarios.

The integration test suite contains one set-up where a cluster of 4
virtual machines, 2 clients and 2 hosts (one with the current stable
and one with the latest Linux kernel version), are spun up and each
client/host pair connects to each other and mounts a virtual/emulated
USB device.
See the [./nix/tests.nix](./nix/test.nix) file for more details.

These tests can be run via:

```nix build -L .#<test-name>```
